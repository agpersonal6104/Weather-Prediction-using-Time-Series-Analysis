# ðŸŒ¦ Weather Prediction using Time Series Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting weather patterns (temperature and rainfall) using **time series data**.  
By leveraging **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, the notebook explores trends, seasonality, and daily/weekly variations in weather data.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- ðŸ“Š **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Checking missing values and handling time-indexed data  
  - Basic descriptive statistics (mean, min, max, std)  

- ðŸ“ˆ **Time Series Visualization**  
  - Temperature variation over time  
  - Rolling averages for trend detection  
  - Seasonal decomposition plots  

- ðŸŒ¡ **Temperature Analysis**  
  - Daily average and weekly aggregation  
  - Monthly box plots for seasonal patterns  
  - Heatmap of daily averages  

- â˜” **Rainfall Analysis**  
  - Total rainfall over fixed time intervals  
  - Rainfall distribution by month

## ðŸ“Š Example Visualizations
- Line plots of temperature fluctuations with rolling mean & std  
- Monthly temperature boxplots (clear summer/winter distinction)  
- Heatmap of daily average temperature across the year
